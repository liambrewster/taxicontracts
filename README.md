# Taxi Contracts Tendering System

So this is a demo project so i can learn the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), so i have taken inspiration from the [School Work jobs board made by AAA Taxis](https://www.schoolcontracts.co.uk/), i will add some additional features to assist my learning.

## What's stack will be in this project?

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)

## The User Stories to acheive with this project

- as a driver, i want to be able to view a list of available school contracts
- as a driver, i want to be able to filter the search by region or postcode
- as a driver, i want to be able to sign up to a newsletter to be notified of new contracts
- as a driver, i want to be able to see the requirments before bidding pickup/ droppoff /number of pickups / est journey mileage / collection times / schedule
- as a driver, i want to be able to subit my details as a bid for that contract

- as an operator, i want to be able to add a contract for bidding
- as an operator, i want to be able to add any notes i feel relevent to the driver to know before bidding

### advanced user story

this will include more advanced options to build after basic first version done

- as a driver i want to be able to login and view my bid submissions
- as a driver i want to be able to login and view my bd outcome summary ( too high / too low etc)
- take payments from operators to use service or view submissions
- as an operator, i want to capture drivers required legal documents to complete the contracts

## how to monetize

after building the project i want to try think of ways this could be monetized as a viable product, so some examples to try build into the system:

- take payments form operator to driver and take a commission
- charge for contract posting / viewing result
- popup adverts on the site

this would be great to learn but this is only a demo project with no view to be live
